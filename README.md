# Popularity Prediction for Spotify Tracks

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that aims to predict the popularity of Spotify tracks based on their audio features. The project utilizes the "spotify-tracks-dataset" to train and evaluate predictive models for estimating the popularity score of tracks.

## Dataset

The "spotify-tracks-dataset" is a tabular dataset in CSV format, containing a range of audio features for tracks across 125 different genres. Each track is associated with a popularity score ranging from 0 to 100, indicating its level of popularity. The dataset also includes information such as track duration, explicit lyrics, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, time signature, and track genre.
